Create an environmental variable JAVA_HOME against path "C:\Program Files\Java\jre1.8.0_202".
To the user path variable add the path "C:\Program Files\Java\jdk1.8.0_202\bin" to it.
From the command prompt to check, run two commands "java -version" and "echo %JAVA_HOME%".

Section-2: Installing Python 2.7

Section-4: Installing Cassandra 3.11.13
---------------------------------------
Visit to "https://cassandra.apache.org/_/download.html" and click on "3.11.13" icon. Next download page
will get open "https://dlcdn.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz". Click
on " https://dlcdn.apache.org/cassandra/3.11.13/apache-cassandra-3.11.13-bin.tar.gz" and download
the tar file. Extract it in a suitable path and to the folder "apache-cassandra-3.11.13".
Now log into the folder "apache-cassandra-3.11.13". Now create two folders - "data" and "cassandraLogs"
under it. Copy the folder path up to "cassandraLogs". Now open the "conf" folder and open "logback.xml"
in text editor and replace all occurrences of "${cassandra.logdir}" at line number 36 with the copied path
using find and replace option. And change the "\" with "/".
So initially: "<file>${cassandra.logdir}/system.log</file>"
After replacement: "<file>E:/Arnab Docs/Cassandra/apache-cassandra-
3.11.13/cassandraLogs/system.log</file>"
In total 4 places this replacement will take place.
Now save and close the file "logback.xml".
Now create one Environment Variable "CASSANDRA_HOME" against the path
"E:\Arnab Docs\Cassandra\apache-cassandra-3.11.13".
At command prompt run and check the command "echo %CASSANDRA_HOME%".
Add Cassandra bin path "E:\Arnab Docs\Cassandra\apache-cassandra-3.11.13\bin" with the user path
variable.
From the command prompt to check, run command "path".

Section-5: Edit cqlsh.bat
-------------------------
Open the file 'cqlsh.bat' from the "E:\Arnab Docs\Cassandra\apache-cassandra-3.11.13\bin" folder and do
the following edit by adding "C:\Python27\" in two places -
C:\Python27\python -V >nul 2>&1
C:\Python27\python "%~dp0\cqlsh.py" %*

Section-6: Execute Cassandra
----------------------------
Now open command prompt (in administrator mode) and go to 
"E:\Arnab Docs\Cassandra\apachecassandra-3.11.13\bin" folder and issue command "cassandra.bat".

Section-7: Execute cqlsh
------------------------
After Cassandra gets loaded in the memory open another command prompt and go to "E:\Arnab
Docs\Cassandra\apache-cassandra-3.11.13\bin" folder and issue command "cqlsh.bat" and start working
with CQL.
To come out from Cassandra use “Ctrl-c” and to come out from cqlsh use command "quit".

Section-8: Eclipse download and install
---------------------------------------
Go to the URL: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
Now click on the link “Download Packages”
Now click on “Windows x86_64” link.
Download the Eclipse zip file and unzip it and run eclipse.exe file.
Create a shortcut of this application on the desktop.
Eclipse should detect the pre-installed Java path. Otherwise go to the
build path and provide the JRE path. Create “JavaWorkSpace”
folder in a suitable path.


CQLSH Classwork
---------------
create keyspace mykeyspace with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy','replication_factor':'1'};

describe keyspaces;

use mykeyspace;

create table stu_data (roll int primary key, name text);

describe stu_data;

select * from stu_data;

insert into stu_data(roll, name) values(101, 'Amit');
insert into stu_data(roll, name) values(102, 'Bikas');
insert into stu_data(roll, name) values(103, 'Mithun');
insert into stu_data(roll, name) values(104, 'Titli');

select * from stu_data;
