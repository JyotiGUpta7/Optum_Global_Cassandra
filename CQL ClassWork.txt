------------- Create a Keyspace -------------
create keyspace FirstKeyspace
 with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy',
 'replication_factor':'1'};

describe keyspaces

desc keyspaces;

use firstkeyspace;


------------- Create a Table -------------
create table books_by_author (
 author_name text,
 publish_year int,
 book_id uuid,
 book_name text,
 rating float,
 primary key((author_name), publish_year, book_id)
 ) with clustering order by (publish_year desc, book_id asc);

-- uuid stands for "universally unique identifier"
-- it is supposed to be unique even outside of the table

describe books_by_author;
desc books_by_author;


------------- Insert Records -------------
insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2009, uuid(), 'Witch & Wizard', 4);

insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2008, uuid(), 'Cross', 4.5);

insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2018, uuid(), 'The President is Missing', 3.5);


------------- Select Records -------------
select * from books_by_author;

// due to publish_year DESC, so records are arranged in the order 2018, 2009, 2008
// as we know that the primary key must be the part of the where clause for efficient query execution
// but specifically, the partition key must be the part of the where clause. Otherwise, it will have 
// to search all the nodes in the cluster

select * from books_by_author
 where author_name = 'James Patterson' and
 publish_year < 2009;

// in the above query the partition key author_name is in the where clause, so it will execute efficiently

select * from books_by_author
 where publish_year = 2009;

// ERROR Code: InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] 
// message="Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have 
// unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance 
// unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"

select * from books_by_author
 where publish_year = 2009 allow filtering;
// now it will provide us the output in a very slow and in a very inefficient way

// as clustering keys are sorted so we can use the rage queries on them
select * from books_by_author
 where author_name = 'James Patterson' and
 publish_year > 2008 and publish_year < 2018;


select * from books_by_author
 where author_name = 'James Patterson' and
 publish_year < 2009 and rating > 4;

// Error Code: InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] 
// message="Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and 
// thus may have unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query 
// despite the performance unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"

// in the above query as rating is not the part of the clustering key, so again causing error

select * from books_by_author
 where author_name = 'James Patterson' and
 publish_year < 2009 and rating > 4
 allow filtering;

// will produce the desired answer in an inefficient way as rating is not the part of the clustering 
// key. So it will have to sort all the records in the machine again to generate the required result.
