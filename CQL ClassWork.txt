------------- Create a Keyspace -------------
create keyspace FirstKeyspace
 with replication = {'class':'SimpleStrategy',
 'replication_factor':'1'};

describe keyspaces

desc keyspaces;

use firstkeyspace;


------------- Create a Table -------------
create table books_by_author (
 author_name text,
 publish_year int,
 book_id uuid,
 book_name text,
 rating float,
 primary key((author_name), publish_year, book_id)
 ) with clustering order by (publish_year desc, book_id asc);

-- uuid stands for "universally unique identifier"
-- it is supposed to be unique even outside of the table

describe books_by_author;
desc books_by_author;


------------- Insert Records -------------
insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2009, uuid(), 'Witch & Wizard', 4);

insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2008, uuid(), 'Cross', 4.5);

insert into books_by_author (author_name, publish_year, book_id, book_name, rating)
 values ('James Patterson', 2018, uuid(), 'The President is Missing', 3.5);


------------- Select Records -------------
select * from books_by_author;

// due to publish_year DESC, so records are arranged in the order 2018, 2009, 2008
// as we know that the primary key must be the part of the where clause for efficient query execution
// but specifically, the partition key must be the part of the where clause. Otherwise, it will have 
// to search all the nodes in the cluster

select * from books_by_author
 where author_name = 'James Patterson' and
 publish_year < 2009;

// in the above query the partition key author_name is in the where clause, so it will execute efficiently

select * from books_by_author
 where publish_year = 2009;

// ERROR Code: InvalidRequest: Error from server: code=2200 [Invalid query] 
// message="Cannot execute this query as it might involve data filtering and thus may have 
// unpredictable performance. If you want to execute this query despite the performance 
// unpredictability, use ALLOW FILTERING"
